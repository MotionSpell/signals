Coding consideration
====================

You need a C++11 compiler.


Write an application
====================

Use the Pipeline namespace.

ORDER OF ALLOC


Write a module
==============

Use the Modules namespace.

Constructor: use hard types.
flush() = EOS

* Inputs

TODO

MAKE A LIST OF BASIC OBJECTS
* Allocator
* Data: shared_ptr
* Output
...


Framework architecture
======================

Signals is layered (from bottom to top):
- signals: a signal-slot system
- modules: a generic set of module interfaces and connection helpers
- mm? TODO multimedia consideration (modules would be agnostic)
- media: some module implementations based on libmodules
- pipeline: pipeline builder and connection helpers


Technical considerations
========================

* Parallelism

Automatic over a thread pool with an ID preventing parallel execution on the same module.

only use a thread if you need the system clock

* Data types

* metadata
