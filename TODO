Mid Term apps:
- socket in, GPAC demux (MP4 or TS), DASH out
- player example plugged with Qt
- GPAC TS demux and mux (for HLS)

Tasks (from higher to lower priority):
- Multiple inputs:
 * fix some test_modules + //Romain
 * rename: output -> prev, input -> next
 * dynamic media types:
  - check 'static' types are ok for connection (most are null now), and remove log traces accordingly
  - remove process(bool): convey metadata with data
  - use pipeline to automatically add converters, instead of being done with modules? (sam's remark: not the pipeline: dshow tried and that's a nightmare)
  - check inputs are not double connected?
  - error prone: hide Module helpers when using modules?
 * DashCast:
  - multi-rep
 * muxer example with two inputs of the same type (e.g. video)
- have super modules: one per family (demux, decoder, transform, etc.) - users don't care about implementation details
- Log
 * remove throw and log::msg duplicates by using  format()
 * give names to modules and prefix the log automatically and create "tools" accordingly + register template instantiation for the module
 * add time to log msg?
 * add colors to log msg
- be able to draw the graph of connections (and allocator states?)
- build:
 * Update build system and deps to use Makefile and zenbuild
 * make module Dlls with https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/by56e477.aspx
 * write un automatic module tester: valgrind + change of mediatypes + null process pkt + do not assume the first timestamp is zero + etc.
- SDL and renderers should be able to run in thread 0

- investigate existing code compatibility:
 * copy the interface of libVLC or GPAC to have their GUIs
 * (especially GStreamer code, see http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~thiagoss/gst-plugins-bad/log/?h=adaptivedemux)
- allow multi-process with pipes (x264, MP4Box -dash-ctx, ...)
- use operators (https://github.com/klmr/named-operator) to describe graphs as pipes?
- GUI: use angular.js? "gui, angular.js, end-point rest, agplv3" @Ffrenchm / OSGi/Pipe/Mesos?/Angular.js?(http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
