Mid Term apps:
- socket in, GPAC demux (MP4 or TS), DASH out

Tasks (from higher to lower priority):
- Multiple inputs:
 * have only one type of module, even for pipelinedModule, and remove pipelinedModule template, convert all modules, remove isSource now that we have input pins
 * dynamic media types: convey metadata with data
 * Add type checking at connect time: not so easy because typeid is not as powerful as dynamic_cast:
//#include <type_traits>
//	if (typeid(output->getMetadata().get()) != typeid(input->getMetadata().get()))
//		throw std::runtime_error("Module connection: incompatible types");
  - dynamic: we could create the input pins when receiving data for the first time
  - use pipeline to automatically add converters, instead of being done with modules? (sam's remark: not the pipeline: dshow tried and that's a nightmare)
 * DashCast:
  - multi-rep
- have super modules: one per family (demux, decoder, transform, etc.) - users don't care about implementation details
- copy the interfae of libVLC or GPAC to have their GUIs
- Log
 * give names to modules and prefix the log automatically and create "tools" accordingly + register template instantiation for the module
 * add time to log msg?
- write un automatic module tester: valgrind + change of mediatypes etc.
- Update build system and deps to use Makefile and zenbuild
- be able to draw the graph of connections (and allocator states?)
- SDL and renderers should be able to run in thread 0

- investigate existing code compatibility (especially GStreamer code, see http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~thiagoss/gst-plugins-bad/log/?h=adaptivedemux)
- allow multi-process with pipes (x264, MP4Box -dash-ctx, ...)
- some modules may still assume the first timestamp is zero...
- make module Dlls with https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/by56e477.aspx
- player example plugged with Qt
- GPAC TS demux and mux (for HLS)
- muxer example with two inputs of the same type (e.g. video)
- use operators (https://github.com/klmr/named-operator) to describe graphs as pipes?
- GUI: use angular.js? "gui, angular.js, end-point rest, agplv3" @Ffrenchm / OSGi/Pipe/Mesos?/Angular.js?(http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
