Mid Term apps:
1. simple player
2. a) dashcast clone (ffmpeg input)
   b) socket in, GPAC demux (MP4 or TS), DASH out

Tasks (from higher to lower priority):
- typedef shared_ptr<Data> (would allow sending signals on Data deletion for example, which is needed to remove sleep() in the pin/allocator waitforCompletion())
- SDL and renderers should be able to run in thread 0

- investigate existing code compatibility (especially GStreamer code, see http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~thiagoss/gst-plugins-bad/log/?h=adaptivedemux)
- be able to draw the graph of connections (and allocator states?)
- remove create() and use C++ exceptions in constructors
- allow multi-process with pipes (x264, MP4Box -dash-ctx, ...)
- player example plugged with Qt
- GPAC TS demux and mux (for HLS)
- muxer example with two inputs of the same type (e.g. video)

Questions (from higher to lower priority):
- eligibility of tasks / ASIO scheduler?
- how to dynamically connect filters
- how to expose an interface to older compilers
- how to expose parameters so that we can plug it with a GUI?
