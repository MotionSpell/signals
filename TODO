Mid Term apps:
2. b) socket in, GPAC demux (MP4 or TS), DASH out

Tasks (from higher to lower priority):
- DashCast:
 * multi-rep
- Log
 * give names to modules and prefix the log automatically and create "tools" accordingly + register template instantiation for the module
- SDL and renderers should be able to run in thread 0

- investigate existing code compatibility (especially GStreamer code, see http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~thiagoss/gst-plugins-bad/log/?h=adaptivedemux)
- be able to draw the graph of connections (and allocator states?)
- allow multi-process with pipes (x264, MP4Box -dash-ctx, ...)
- some modules may still assume the first timestamp is zero...
- player example plugged with Qt
- GPAC TS demux and mux (for HLS)
- muxer example with two inputs of the same type (e.g. video)
- use operators (https://github.com/klmr/named-operator) to describe graphs as pipes?
- GUI: use angular.js? "gui, angular.js, end-point rest, agplv3" @Ffrenchm / OSGi/Pipe/Mesos?/Angular.js?(http://www.freecodecamp.com/)
- GPU: 4K60:10/IntelTranscodingSupport->libMFX / GPU: http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2015/presentation/S5613-Abhijit-Patait.pdf

Questions (from higher to lower priority):
- eligibility of tasks / ASIO scheduler?
- how to dynamically connect filters
- how to expose an interface to older compilers
- how to expose parameters so that we can plug it with a GUI?
