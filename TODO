Mid Term apps:
- dashcast clone
- simple player

Tasks (from higher to lower priority):
- modules should decide about their synchronicity, and integrate a serializer/reorderer in libmm
- make audio format conversion work
- make libav modules more independant
- audio should run in a separate thread (like network reception etc.)
- handle clocks (first: real-time to play audio)
- SDL and renderers should be able to run in thread 0
- be able to draw the graph of connections (and allocator states?)

Questions (from higher to lower priority):
- how to dynamically connect filters
- use C++ strong typing for data (would prevent from connecting dynamically, like an external DLL)
- how to expose an interface to older compilers
